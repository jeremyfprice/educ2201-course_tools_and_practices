#COURSE TOOLS AND PRACTICES

##EDUC2201: TEACHING WITH DIGITAL MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

*"Teaching is two-parts planning, one-part reflection, and extra heavy on the experimentation." ~ Rebecca Alber*


*"It seems to me that that, finally, is what good teaching is all about.... Somehow or another, skill and knowledge are integrated into some kind of a human connection." ~ Mike Rose*
