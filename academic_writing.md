# Academic Writing Practices

Writing for academic assignments - and your writing assignments for this class are considered academic even if they draw on your own experiences - can be difficult. In order to succeed as an academic writer, you need to adopt a certain way of writing even if it doesn't sound like you (or sound like what you think you sound like). The important thing to remember is that you can inject your voice—your ideas, sensibilities, and approaches—into your writing even while making use of the style that is appropriate for an academic assignment.

There are two academic writing practices I have found many students find challenging: showing (not telling) your ideas and adopting the appropriate academic "tone." We will be working on these practices over the course of the semester, but here are some brief guidelines to get you started.

## Showing What You Mean With Detail
It isn’t enough just to tell your reader your idea, you have to show them what you mean. In your writing, you should be showing your reader what your ideas look like.

For example, in Part I of your Living Document, I am asking you to define the terms learning, understanding, and creativity. I am also asking you to provide examples of what these terms look like based on your own experiences or based on a picture that you construct in your mind's eye.

I have found it useful to think of it as "Remembering and Reporting" or "Imagining and Reporting." Really get a clear picture in your head of the event by asking yourself the questions:

*	Who's involved?
*	Where is it happening?
*	How is it unfolding?
*	What impact does it have on my thinking?

Once that picture is in your head, report on it: write down the details in a concise and compelling manner. Make sure you include details to provide a sense of the full picture of your ideas. This is something we will be working on over the course of the semester, so do not get too discouraged if it is difficult at first. I will work to provide useful feedback to help you with this.

## Writing with Appropriate Academic Tone

When you write with appropriate tone, you are indicating that you understand two basic things: what you are writing and who you are writing to. Adopting the appropriate tone builds your credibility as a serious student and as a professional teacher-in-the-making. As such, you should not write in a conversational manner or as you might write a note to a friend or classmate. In all of your assignments (with the exception of the weekly exit tweets) you should be writing as if you are writing to your professor or to a future employer.

That's not to say that there is anything wrong with the way you speak. In fact, if you find it easier, you are welcome to write a first draft in a conversational tone and then translate it into an academic tone. This is a generalizable practice referred to as "learning to be pragmatic" in linguistics. Learning to communicate differently according to the context and the audience (called "code switching" in linguistics) will help you succeed in many settings. Again, this does not mean that there is anything wrong with the way you speak, who you are, or where you come from; it simply indicates that you understand how to communicate in different settings.

In order to adopt an academic tone in your writing, here a few things to be mindful of:

* **Use of exclamation points (!):** Typically exclamation points tell the reader that the author is enthusiastic about something, which is great! Remember that your task in academic writing is to show, not tell. So leave out the exclamation points and show your reader your enthusiasm.

* **Slang and sayings:** We often intersperse some wonderful witty and folksy sayings, slang, and words when we talk. These make for engaging and lively conversations. While a well-considered and well-placed witty or folksy saying can really highlight your creativity and sense of identity (your voice), you want the focus to be on your ideas. Use slang and sayings sparingly.

* **Clear, concise, and smooth:** Essays written for academic purposes are typically written in a way that is clear and gets your point across. Being concise in your writing is also valued, but make sure that you include sufficient detail to report and show your ideas. Lastly, your writing should flow smoothly from one idea to the next.

* **Your professor is absent-minded:** Remember those three- and five-paragraph essay assignments you had in elementary school? While a bit reductionist, there was a reason for doing them. It's a great practice in academic writing to let your reader know what you're going to talk about and then summarize what you talked about. This is roughly your "introduction" and your "conclusion" from those essay assignments. This helps keep the focus on your ideas.

* **Getting the right read-aloud:** If you read your writing out loud and it sounds like you are having a conversation with a friend, then your essay is probably not written with an academic tone. In a way, you want your writing to sound pretty serious and somber when you read it out loud (but not boring). This allows your fascinating ideas to "pop" and come to the forefront.

This is something we will be working on over the course of the semester, and I will work to provide you with helpful and useful feedback to help you adapt the appropriate academic tone. Do not get too discouraged if it is difficult at first; adopting the appropriate academic tone is something you grow into.
