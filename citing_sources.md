# Citing Your Sources

Giving credit where credit is due is something that is important to do when writing for University-level work. It helps both you and your professors recognize how your thought process has emerged from other people's work. I am asking you to bring specific ideas from class discussions and lectures and from the readings into your Reflection Write-Ups. When you do, you must cite these ideas.

In this class (and all of your education courses), you will be required to use the **American Psychological Association (APA)** guidelines for citations. This is the standard for most academic work in education. For your purposes, you will primarily be working with three different types of sources: journal articles, blog posts and class discussions/lectures. APA involves two parts: in-text citations and a References list.

##In-Text Citations

The in-text citations are the markers that you use as you are writing to show that you are using this source. Articles and blog posts (which represent most of what you read) follow the same in-text citation format. Here is a reference to a post from John Spencer's blog, *Education Rethink*:

>There are many reasons why teachers are not using technology, including fear, lack of leadership and lack of technology resources (Spencer, 2012).

Note that it involves parentheses **()**, the **authorâ€™s last name** and the ***year* that it was published**.

##References List

The References list comes at the very end of your essay, and you would give it the heading "References." Here is an example References list that includes both a blog post and a journal article:

>Sekeres, D., Coiro, J., Castek, J., & Guzniczak, L. A. (2014). Wondering + online inquiry = learning. *Kappan*, 96(3), 44-48.
>
>Spencer, J. (2012, July 14). 11 Reasons Teachers Aren't Using Technology. Retrieved from: http://www.educationrethink.com/2012/07/11-reasons-teachers-arent-using.html

In the References list, here's what you see: the **authors** (last name, first initial), **year** (article) or **date** (blog) it was published, **title** of the article or blog post. Then, for an article, you see the **title of the journal** or magazine it is in, the volume, the **issue**, and then the **page numbers**. For a blog you see "Retrieved from:" and then the **link** to the blog post.

##Class Lectures and Discussions

Citing from class lectures and discussions are a little different because they are considered *personal communications.* You need to include in-text citations, but you do not need to include it in the list of References. You just need to make sure to include the name of the person who said what you are referring to. For example, if you are referring to something that I said in a lecture, you would use J. Price; for a classmate, you would use their first initial and their last name. See the table below for examples.

##Examples and Models

| **Source** | **In-Text Citation** | **References List** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Article** | (Sekeres, Coiro, Castek, & Guzniczak, 2014) | Sekeres, D., Coiro, J., Castek, J., & Guzniczak, L. A. (2014). Wondering + online inquiry = learning. *Kappan*, 96(3), 44-48. |
| **Blog Post** | (Spencer, 2012) | Spencer, J. (2012, July 14). 11 Reasons Teachers Aren't Using Technology. Retrieved from: http://www.educationrethink.com/2012/07/11-reasons-teachers-arent-using.html |
| **Class Lecture/Discussion** (when the *professor* says something) | (J. Price, Educational technology lecture, April 3, 2014) | You do not put anything in the reference list for a class discussion or lecture. |
| **Class Lecture/Discussion** (when a *student* says something) | (I. M. A. Student, Educational technology discussion, February 15, 2014) | You do not put anything in the reference list for a class discussion or lecture. |
