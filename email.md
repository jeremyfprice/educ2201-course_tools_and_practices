# Stay Current by Keeping In Touch Outside of Class

Communications between me and you outside of class will occur over email. Please ***do not send me a message through Blackboard***. Please make sure to **check your Fairmont State email on a regular basis** (at least 4-5 times per week). If you do not have a smart phone, a computer or internet access at home or in your dorm room, make it a regular practice to go to the library and check your email there.

Before writing to me (or any of your professors) with a question or problem, check your resources first: look in the syllabus, dig through the Course Tools and Practices document, ask a classmate. Then, read [Re: Your Recent Email to Your Professor](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay). Following the authors' advice will make you look much more professional in the eyes of your professors.

It is well worth your time to read the entire article, but here are the authors' main points:


1. **Use a clear subject line.** Identify the reason you are contacting me in the subject line, so I know what to expect when reading the email.
2. **Use a salutation and signature.** You can call me either Dr. Price or Professor Price, and then sign off with your full name. It's just a polite thing to do.
3. **Use standard punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and grammar.** You are not sending me a text.
4. **Do your part in solving what you need to solve.** Let me know what you've done to figure out the problem. That way, you appear responsible, and I can help you beyond what you've already done.
5. **Beware of concerns about entitlement.** Rightly or wrongly, college students often get a bad rap. Take responsibility when writing with a problem, and let me know what you could have done differently.
6. **Add a touch of humanity.** Let me know something you enjoyed or learned in class. It's always nice to let your professors know that you are listening to them.

Doing your part and writing in a clear and professional manner will go a long way.
