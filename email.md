# Stay Current by Keeping In Touch Outside of Class

Communications between me and you outside of class will occur over email. Please ***do not send me a message through Blackboard***. Please make sure to **check your Fairmont State email on a regular basis** (at least 4-5 times per week). If you do not have a smart phone, a computer or internet access at home or in your dorm room, make it a regular practice to go to the library and check your email there.

1. **Use a clear subject line.** Identify the reason you are contacting me in the subject line, so I know what to expect when reading the email.
2. **Use a salutation and signature.** You can call me either Dr. Price or Professor Price, and then sign off with your full name. It's just a polite thing to do.
3. **Use standard punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and grammar.** You are not sending me a text.
4. **Do your part in solving what you need to solve.** Let me know what you've done to figure out the problem. That way, you appear responsible, and I can help you beyond what you've already done.
5. **Beware of concerns about entitlement.** Rightly or wrongly, college students often get a bad rap. Take responsibility when writing with a problem, and let me know what you could have done differently.
6. **Add a touch of humanity.** Let me know something you enjoyed or learned in class. It's always nice to let your professors know that you are listening to them.
