# Making Sense of Models

In addition to the rubrics, I will be giving you models of successful work. These models will be drawn from previous student work, my own creations, and examples found online. Learning to read and use models for success is an important practice to cultivate. Here are some steps you can follow to help you with this:

* Look over the Project Package and rubric and make sure you have a sense of what is expected of you.

* Look at each model and ask yourself the following questions:
 * How does this model fulfill the requirements for the project?
 * How does this model not fulfill the requirements for the project?
 * How would I score this model based on the rubric?
 * What are some things that I like about this model?
 * What are some things that I don't like about this model and feel I could do better?

* Start thinking about how you want to adapt what you have seen into your own project.
* Create your own project and compare and contrast with the models, the Project Package, and the rubric; revise your own project as you see fit.

You should not be seeking to *copy* what someone has done, but instead using the models as guidelines to work within and ideas to adapt and make your own. Providing examples of work as models of success has a long and proven track record in educational research. This is something you should consider doing when you become an educator.
