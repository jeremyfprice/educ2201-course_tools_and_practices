# Take Knowledge from Class to Projects by Taking Notes

We will be discussing a number of important ideas in class that you will need to use in your assignments and projects. I will be asking you to write how you used the ideas we discussed in class to complete your projects, the more specific the better. There are a number of ways to take notes but the most important thing is that you find the method of note-taking that works for you. Remember that **effective note-taking is more than writing down bullet points from PowerPoint slides.** A particularly helpful way to take notes, and bridge your time before, during, and after class, is the *Cornell Note-Taking System.*

To help you develop the practice of note-taking, **I will be asking you to cite specific information from class and from the readings in your Reflection Write-Ups** for your Performances of Understandings. Taking notes will help you to refer back to our discussions and use them in your Reflection Write-Ups. An important part of becoming a successful learner is moving ideas from one context to another, and I hope that this process will help you build some of the same practices with your own students in the future.
